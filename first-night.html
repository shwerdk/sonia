Detailed Steps:<br>
1. Gather Wood:
Immediately after spawning, locate and break a few trees to obtain wood planks. This is crucial for crafting your first tools and shelter. <br>
2. Craft Tools:
Use the crafting table to create a basic wooden pickaxe, axe, and sword. These tools will be essential for further resource gathering and defense.<br> 
3. Build a Quick Shelter:
Construct a basic shelter by walling yourself in with blocks like dirt or cobblestone. This provides a safe space during the night when hostile mobs are active. <br>
4. Light Up Your Shelter:
Place torches around your shelter to prevent hostile mobs from spawning nearby. Torches also provide light, making it easier to navigate your shelter. <br>
5. Gather Food:
Find and gather food sources like raw meat from passive mobs (cows, sheep, pigs) to prevent starvation. You can use your crafted tools to hunt these animals. <br>
6. Set a Spawn Point:
Craft a bed using wool from sheep and place it in your shelter to set a spawn point. This allows you to respawn safely if you die, and you can use it to skip the night. <br>
7. Avoid Hostile Mobs:
Stay in your shelter and avoid wandering around in the dark during the night to prevent encounters with hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, and creepers. <br>
8. Mine Stone:
Once you have a wooden pickaxe, mine stone blocks to obtain cobblestone. Cobblestone is a more durable material for building, and it can be used to make better tools. <br>
9. Craft a Furnace:
Craft a furnace to cook raw meat, which provides better nutrition and health.<br> 
10. Prepare for the Next Day:
Make sure you have enough food, wood, and tools to continue your exploration and construction during the next day. </p>
